<p>Hey There, I'm Julia, a small town girl chasing after big dreams. I'm into everything sports, fitness, and JESUS!</p>
<hr>

<p>I transfered from Middle Georgia State University, where I played softball for two years. I am now studying sports managment at the University of Georgia. I just finished up an internship with Atlanta United, working with the fan interaction team and now interning with UGA sports, working for the event managment department. Being on the other side of sports is very different for me. I am used to being the one playing the sport and now I am working for the athletes. It's a great experience to be on the other side of athletics. 
<hr>

<p>I'm big into fitness. I believe in sweat, hard work, encouragment and loving your body. I am very big into my faith and love traveling to spread the word. I recently went to Jamaica and plan to go to the Domincan Republic soon.
